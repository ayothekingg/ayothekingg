# Hey, you found me :)

My name is James Amoo. Sometimes I write codes, other times I just watch movies. Most times, I love writing technical pieces to simplify concepts for developers.

Currently doing interesting Devrel stuff for Pieces, check out some of my technical blogs on the Pieces Blog:

[P.S: These aren't just plain technical content, they're carefully written to show just how much Pieces helps developers in their day-to-day activities. There's a piece of Pieces(pun intended) in every bit of it.]
